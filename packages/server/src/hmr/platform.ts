/**
 * THE platform: the one hot-swappable unit this build of the server packages.
 *
 * The repo carries exactly one platform — versions exist BETWEEN deployments
 * (this packaged build vs the next bundle pushed over HTTP), not as parallel
 * files. When a future build changes the context shape, it bumps `version`
 * and ships the migrator alongside the new schema; the previous shape lives
 * only in already-parked documents out in the world.
 *
 * PLATFORM LAYER — WHERE POLICY BELONGS. Anything a deployment might want to
 * change (business APIs, what an agent sees, how a capability behaves) goes
 * here rather than in the runtime, and reaches installations by one HTTP push
 * instead of a rebuild. Worth remembering when something looks like it must
 * live in the shell: this code runs INSIDE the server process, so in-process
 * effects (e.g. extending process.env for the shells agents spawn) are
 * deliverable from boot() with no runtime change. See packages/hmr/README.md.
 *
 * This packaged platform carries the WHOLE business surface (see app.ts):
 * every business service and route is assembled inside create() over the runtime's
 * published capabilities, and serves through the seam in ../hmr/http-seam.ts — it
 * sees every request before the runtime's own routes do and answers null for the
 * ones it does not own. A pushed bundle therefore replaces the business wholesale:
 * adding or changing an endpoint or a service needs no runtime change.

/**
 * What the runtime boots: a shell around the inner App, so the App can re-assemble itself
 * while the runtime keeps holding the same instance.
 *
 * A plugin change is configuration, and configuration changes while the process runs; the
 * tree has to be built again for it to take. That rebuild is the platform's own business —
 * policy, shipped by push, working on every runtime — so it happens here, above the seam,
 * with the kernel's `upgrade` over the inner instance: same impl, same iface, same parked
 * document, the swap a hot push performs but without a new bundle. A boot that fails is
 * recovered onto the previous document, as a failed push is, and reported as false.
 *
 * Every member of the outer API forwards to the inner App of the moment. Re-assemblies are
 * serialized on `op`; a runtime-driven dispose (a push landing) disposes the inner App at
 * once, as the App's own dispose always did, unless a re-assembly is mid-swap — then the
 * dispose waits for it through `drained`, which the kernel awaits before booting the
 * successor. One window stays open by design: `park()` cannot wait, so a push
 * that parks exactly while a re-assembly is mid-swap parks the tree being replaced.
