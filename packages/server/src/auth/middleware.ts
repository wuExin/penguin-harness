/**
 * Auth middleware: `Authorization: Bearer <local API token>` -> the built-in admin, or
 * session cookie -> auth_sessions row -> user; either way the user is injected into c.var.
 *
 * The Bearer path authenticates the boot's local API token (`<root>/api-token`, see
 * auth/api-token.ts) as the admin — the CLI's and agents' machine-local credential; it
 * applies to every route behind this middleware, SSE endpoints included (the CLI
 * consumes SSE via fetch with headers). A Bearer header that does not match fails the
 * request rather than falling back to the cookie: silently downgrading a wrong explicit
 * credential would mask misconfiguration.
 *
 * Accessing a protected API while logged out -> 401 `{error:{code:"unauthorized"}}`.
 * CSRF: SameSite=Lax plus a Content-Type an HTML form cannot forge (see jsonOnlyWrites).
 * That guard stays for Bearer requests too — the CLI always sends application/json.
