/**
 * Plugin loading: WHICH plugins a deployment runs is CONFIGURATION, not capability
 * baked into the platform.
 *
 * The configuration is per PROJECT (the `[plugins]` table in `.project_config.toml`), because machines
 * are lent to Projects and that is what says which machines a plugin has to reach. Loading
 * is per PROCESS, though — there is one module tree — so what a deployment runs is the
 * CLOSURE: the union over its Projects. A plugin any Project asks for is in the tree, and
 * what it contributes is visible to all of them.
 *
 * The closure is read from the FILES, without the database: this runs at boot, before the
 * platform exists, and a Project is a directory holding a `.project_config.toml`.
 *
 * Resolution is anchored at `process.argv[1]`, for the same reason the packaged
 * bundle's own resolver is: a bundle running from `hmr/store` has no node_modules of
 * its own, so anchoring at the bundle would find nothing.
 *
 * Failure is per-entry and non-fatal: an unresolvable or malformed plugin is reported
 * and skipped, leaving its capability unavailable rather than failing the boot. A
 * plugin is a set of modules (core plugin/index.ts): decorated classes, named by the
 * default export, whose manifests the package's generated `ifaces.json` carries.

/**
 * The plugin host THIS App runs — built by the PLATFORM, at its own boot (hmr/platform.ts).
 *
 * This is the point of the whole file living below the seam: which plugins a deployment runs
 * is configuration, and how that configuration is read is policy. Both therefore travel by
 * push. A machine whose program predates a new rule — the Project closure replacing the data
 * root's plugins.json, say — learns it from the pushed platform, instead of being unable to
 * act on a list it has already been given until someone restarts it.
 *
 * What the registry keeps is the imported objects, claimed here and handed back at the
 * commit: state, not a capability. An entry the closure no longer asks for is simply not in
 * the new host; its modules leave the tree with the App that had them.
