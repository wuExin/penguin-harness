/**
 * The TypeScript compiler, loaded when something first needs it.
 *
 * The compiler decides whether the interfaces a package was written against still fit this
 * platform (./iface-check.ts). It is a dependency of this package, but the platform also runs as a single pushed bundle that sits outside any
 * `node_modules`, on machines whose program may predate that dependency — so the specifier
 * is kept out of the bundler's sight and resolved at run time, in three places: beside this
 * module, beside the program that is running, and in the assets the push carried it in
 * (scripts/typescript-payload.mjs), the way node-pty is found.
