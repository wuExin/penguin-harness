/**
 * The machines service: this server's own `~/.ssh/config` as a list of targets, and putting
 * this build on one of them, reaching it, and keeping it configured.
 *
 * ONE JOB at a time — an install or a connect — started by POST and polled by the Web App
 * for its progress lines. The job lives in this App's memory; what it achieved is in web.db
 * (MachinesRepo): which machines carry this program, the session held to each, and which
 * Project uses which. Every word to a machine leaves through its MachineConnection
 * (transport/connection.ts) — ONE ssh session per machine, carrying commands on its stdin
 * and every TCP connection as a channel through its SOCKS port — and every request to a
 * machine's API is made as its admin, with a session this server mints over the ssh access
 * that installed it.
 *
 * The JOB is not persisted. It lives in this App's memory and dies with it (see the park
 * list in ../hmr/platform.ts — it is on the SUSPENDED side): a hot push during an install
 * loses the progress log, and the recovery is to run it again, which is safe because every
 * step is idempotent — the far side's installer stages, smoke-tests and swaps, and an
 * unchanged version is a no-op.
 *
 * A machine BELONGS TO A PROJECT. The host is shared — one program, one ssh config entry —
 * but which Projects use it is this server's own bookkeeping, because a Project's machines
 * are where that Project's work runs. A host installed for another Project is reported as
 * `elsewhere` rather than hidden: adopting it costs a row, while re-installing costs a
 * 30 MB transfer to reach the same place.
