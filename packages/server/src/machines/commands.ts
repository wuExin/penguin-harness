/**
 * The exact ssh/scp invocations a remote install runs, built as argv arrays (no shell on this
 * side) plus the small commands the far side executes. Pure, so every command this app would
 * run against someone's machine is unit-visible.
 *
 * Three things run through a remote SHELL — probe, run the release installer, unpack the
 * replicated hmr store — and each has a POSIX and a Windows form, because a default Windows
 * OpenSSH session is cmd.exe, where `;`, `$VAR`, `'…'` and `rm` mean nothing. The installer
 * itself is the ordinary one (install.sh, install.ps1), downloading the pinned release from
 * the remote's own network.
 *
 * COUNT THE HANDSHAKES. A handshake to a distant or loaded host costs tens of seconds — so
 * everything rides the ONE connection ssh-session.ts holds per machine: commands, the
 * installer and the store on its stdin, every TCP connection through its SOCKS port. A POSIX
 * install is therefore the installer going in on that stdin, the same shape as the documented
 * `curl … | sh`, which is what lets the scratch directory, the scp and the cleanup
 * disappear entirely.
 *
 * Two further rules encoded here:
 * - **BatchMode.** A GUI app has no terminal: an ssh that decides to ask for a password or a
 *   key passphrase would hang forever with nothing to type into. BatchMode turns that into an
 *   immediate, readable failure — v1 is key/agent auth, exactly as the design says.
 * - **The user override rides the command line, never the config.** `-o User=…` selects the
 *   account for this connection; `~/.ssh/config` is read-only to us.

 * The CLI these commands run on a machine: the one PUSHED to it, not the one installed.
 *
 * Run out of the layout's program directory by absolute path, because sshd's non-login
 * shell has no `~/.local/bin` on PATH — the symlink the installer drops there is for a
 * person at a terminal, not for us. The directory is laid out as bin/ lib/ web/ node/ by
 * install.sh (`PENGUIN_INSTALL_DIR`, which runInstallScriptCommand names), with the
 * launcher exec'ing `node/bin/node lib/dist/…` (scripts/launchers/penguin). The data root
 * rides along as PENGUIN_HOME: the CLI's `server status`, `server stop` and `auth token`
 * all act on the root they are given, and the profile's root is not the default one.
 * The profile rides along too, as PENGUIN_PROFILE: the server started by this command
 * reaches machines of its own, and it reads its layout from that variable (layout.ts) —
 * without it a dev-profile server would reach the NEXT machine's release installation.
 * Named for the release profile as well, so an account that exports the variable cannot
 * turn a release server into a dev one.
 *
 * `bin/penguin` is the released program, and a release only carries the subcommands this
 * side asks for (`server status`, `auth token`, `server --detach`) once a release has
 * shipped them. Reaching a machine would then be impossible until the next release —
 * including for the build that introduces reaching machines at all.
 *
 * `dist/penguin-hmr.js` is the entry that loads the CLI out of that machine's own hmr store
 * (packages/cli/src/penguin-hmr.ts), which is the CLI this server pushed there. It has
 * shipped in the archive since long before any of this, so a machine installed by any
 * release can run the current CLI. What it cannot do is run one that was never pushed: a
 * machine with an empty store answers `no CLI pushed to <root>`, and the remedy is to
 * install — which replicates the store on its way through (install-server.ts).
 *
 * Invoked through the bundled runtime rather than the launcher, because there is no
 * launcher for this entry. Machines installed from here always carry that runtime: the
 * install runs install.sh without `--universal`, which is the only mode that omits it.
 *
 * Spelled in the dialect of the shell that will read it. A Windows sshd hands a command to
 * cmd.exe, where `$HOME` is four literal characters and the bundled runtime is
 * `node\node.exe` (scripts/launchers/penguin.cmd) — so the POSIX form is not "not found"
 * there, it is a different sentence. `%USERPROFILE%` is what install.ps1 defaults to.
