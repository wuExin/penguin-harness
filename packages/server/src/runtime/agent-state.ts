/**
 * The Session runtime's in-memory state, held apart from the logic that works on it.
 *
 * Everything a SessionManager remembers between two calls lives here and nowhere else: the
 * manager's own fields of the same names point at these, so its logic reads and writes them
 * exactly as it did when it owned them. The component holds data only — no method here
 * decides anything.
 *
 * What is NOT here was never the manager's to hold: the Trace and the `sessions` rows are on
 * disk, and the database, the channel hub and the auth state belong to the process.
