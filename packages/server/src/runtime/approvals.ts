/**
 * Tool call approval: ApproveFn factory + pending
 * approval registry.
 *
 * Approval mode semantics match the CLI (packages/cli/src/approval.ts):
 *   allow-all auto-approves; deny-all auto-denies; read-only allows read-only tools
 *   (permission==="r") and routes the rest to manual approval; always-ask routes
 *   everything to manual approval. Routing to manual approval registers a pending entry
 *   and pushes an `approval_request` via SSE, suspending until the frontend decides via
 *   `POST /approvals/:toolCallId`; no timeout — pending approvals are resolved to deny
 *   when the Task is interrupted (then proceeds through the abort flow).
 *
 * An unattended Session takes that one route differently: there is no frontend to ask, so
 * the call is denied on the spot instead of suspending forever (see `unattended` below).
 *
 * Every approval decision re-reads the current approval_mode (`getMode` reads the DB),
 * so mode changes take effect immediately.
 * Docs: /docs/tools § "Approval".
