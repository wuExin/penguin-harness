/**
 * Ordered, versioned schema migrations.
 *
 * `schema.ts` declares the shape a FRESH database is created with. It cannot express a
 * CHANGE — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` only ever says "should exist", so re-running it
 * converges a database toward the current declaration without ever knowing, or recording,
 * which state it came from. That is why a build could not tell a 0.2.4 database from a
 * 0.2.7 one, and why the only safe change was an additive one.
 *
 * A migration says what CHANGED, runs once, and leaves the database stamped with how far
 * it has come (`PRAGMA user_version`). Two rules make that stamp trustworthy:
 *
 * FROZEN DDL. A migration spells out its own SQL and never imports SCHEMA_SQL. Referring
 * to the live declaration would make an old migration silently mean something new every
 * time the schema moves, which is the property that makes migrations auditable at all.
 *
 * ONE WAY, IN ORDER. Versions are contiguous from 1 and never renumbered or rewritten
 * once released — a database that already stamped version N will never run N again, so
 * editing N only changes what NEW databases get, and silently forks the two.
 *
 * `swapSafe` is this codebase's extra axis, and it exists because of hot updates. A
 * pushed platform boots against a live database and is ROLLED BACK to its predecessor if
 * it fails; the predecessor then runs on whatever the migration already did. Additive
 * work survives that (the older build does not know the new table, so it never touches
 * it) — narrowing work does not. Anything that drops, retypes, constrains, or reshapes
 * is `swapSafe: false` and must be refused on the swap path rather than half-applied
 * (see `migrate`'s `swapPath` option).
 *
 * DOWN, AND WHO DOES NOT CALL IT. Every migration declares an undo — or declares `null`
 * to say it has none, which is a decision the author has to make rather than omit. What
 * `down` is NOT is the hot-update rollback mechanism. When a pushed platform fails to boot
 * the runtime reverts to its PREDECESSOR and the schema stays where the migration left it:
 * undoing DDL inside a process whose boot just failed would run destructive statements
 * against a half-known state, and `swapSafe` exists precisely so that not undoing is safe —
 * the predecessor does not know the new table or column, so it never touches it. `down` is
 * an operator's tool, called deliberately (`rollbackTo`), never by the swap.
 *
 * It is also LOSSY by nature: undoing "add a table" drops that table with its rows in it.
 * Each `down` below names what its rows were.
 *
 * ADOPTION. Databases created before this file existed are all stamped 0 while sitting in
 * genuinely different shapes, so a migration must tolerate finding its work already done.
 * That is not only a version-1 concern: `schema.ts` still DECLARES the current shape in
 * full and `openDatabase` still runs its ensureColumn list, so a database can arrive at a
 * migration with that migration's work already applied by the declarative track. Until
 * SCHEMA_SQL is frozen to a baseline and every later change is a migration, every
 * migration here stays idempotent — `IF NOT EXISTS`, or the same `ensureColumn` guard the
 * declarative track uses. Once that double track is gone, a bare `CREATE TABLE` that
 * fails loudly becomes the point.
