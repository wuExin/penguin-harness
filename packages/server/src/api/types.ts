/**
 * Web API DTO contract — request/response types shared between server routes and the
 * frontend SPA (single source of truth).
 *
 * These field definitions are authoritative for the Web API contract. Conventions:
 *   - DTO fields use camelCase; OmniMessage keeps the core protocol as-is (snake_case shell),
 *     no conversion;
 *   - This file holds only types, no implementation; exposed to the frontend via package
 *     exports `"./api"` for type-only import;
 *   - Types are taken only from core's pure subpaths (omnimessage / interfaces), so the
 *     frontend can safely reference them.
 *
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/server-api.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/server-api) is the
 * public route/SSE reference for this contract — keep it in sync when changing DTOs.
