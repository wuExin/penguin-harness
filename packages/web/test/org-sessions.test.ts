/**
 * The company sidebar's 工位 group (features/company/org-sessions.ts) and the development
 * list's organization filter (session-grouping): a desk row per employee in chart order
 * whether or not a desk exists, the session list's live status winning over both snapshots,
 * the messaging mark read from the sessions route and patched by a bind or an unbind,
 * the glyph a row draws, an employee's own state read from every Session the organization
 * attributes to it — its ticket sessions included, though no list shows them as a group —
 * and the render-time guard that keeps an organization's row out of the development list when
 * one still reaches it (the server leaves them out of the list's own fetches; see
 * sessions-own-rows.test.ts).
