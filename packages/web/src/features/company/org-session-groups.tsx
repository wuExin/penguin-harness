/**
 * The 工位 group under the company sidebar's channel list, and the collapsed rail's twin.
 *
 * One row per employee, in chart order, expanded by default: the organization's people are
 * its primary objects, and a desk is where a person is talked to. Every employee has a desk
 * session from the moment it is hired, so a row normally carries one; a row whose id these
 * caches have not learned yet still stands there and opens the desk on click, exactly as the
 * org chart's card does. Ticket sessions have no group of their own — a session exists
 * because a ticket started it, and it is read from that ticket's drawer, where the work it
 * belongs to is on screen beside it.
 *
 * A row that names a desk session carries the development list's row menu (right-click, and
 * the hover ellipsis), pared down to the two actions an organization leaves to the reader:
 * copy the Session id, and bind the desk to a messaging bot. A desk's title and its lifecycle are
 * the organization's — the employee names it, hiring and firing open and close it — so
 * rename, archive, delete and pin are not offered here. The binding's own indicator is read
 * from the organization's sessions route, which marks a desk the way the Session's own row is
 * marked; the session list store never holds a desk, so it cannot say.
 *
 * The group reads the company store's caches (the organization's chart and its sessions
 * route), so opening it costs no request; the session the shell is on is marked in place. The
 * run marks come from the session list's live statuses wherever it holds the row — those
 * caches are only re-read on an organization event, and a run ending publishes none
 * (org-sessions.ts).
