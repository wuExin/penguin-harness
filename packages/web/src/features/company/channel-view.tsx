/**
 * One channel: its header, the stream of the loaded days — a separator per day, one bubble per
 * message, each body rendered as Markdown with its @-mentions kept as chips (stronger when
 * they address the reader), `system` messages as centred banners in the reader's own language,
 * ticket and session references as chips that open them, an unread divider at the read
 * cursor — and the composer beneath it. The view follows the stream while it is at the bottom;
 * scrolled up, new messages collect behind a pill that returns to the latest. Sitting at the
 * bottom of today marks this channel read, which is what clears its badge in the sidebar and
 * the rail. Nothing here delivers to an employee unless it is @-mentioned, and only inside
 * this channel's membership; the empty state and the header's "?" say so.
 *
 * Opening a channel assembles its whole first screen before the first render — today's day
 * file, then earlier ones until the stream holds enough messages or the day budget runs out
 * (initialDaysToLoad) — so the reader lands at the bottom of real history rather than on a
 * blank day, and without the scroll jump a prepend after the first paint would cost. Anything
 * older stays behind "earlier", which prepends one day file per click.
 *
 * The stream is drawn the way every chat client draws one, because a channel is read the way
 * every chat is. Somebody else's run stands on the left: the avatar once, top-aligned so that
 * it sits beside the sender's name — with the relay chip beside it from the second hop on, the
 * whole @-chain rule in its tooltip — and the run's bubbles under both, in the column the name
 * starts. Who is speaking is one mark, so the two halves of it stay on one line: an avatar tied
 * to the run's last bubble drifts a screenful below its own name as soon as a message runs
 * long. The reader's own run stands on the right in its own tint, with no avatar and no name
 * (a screen reader gets one, since a side and a colour are not something every reader can
 * read). Each bubble carries its own time at its bottom-right, inside it: a time that only
 * appears on hover is a time a touch reader never sees, and one time per run leaves every
 * later message in a long run unstamped.
 *
 * A `system` line is one sentence, so it stays one muted line rather than a Markdown body: the
 * server writes it twice — as English text and as a structured notice — and the notice is what
 * this renders (channel-notices.ts), falling back to the text for a line written before that
 * field existed.
 *
 * A channel the reader has not joined offers Join instead of the composer — people may read
 * every channel but post only in the ones they are in; joining asks first, because it is what
 * puts this channel's @-mentions in front of the reader from then on. An archived channel says
 * it is read-only. Only the messages are essential: the chart and the Project's member list feed
 * names and the invite picker, so a hiccup there degrades names to ids rather than blocking
 * the page.
