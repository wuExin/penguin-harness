/**
 * The company sidebar's 工位 group, as pure shaping (unit tested) over the organization's
 * chart, its sessions route and the live statuses the user channel has reported: one row per
 * EMPLOYEE, in chart order, whether or not these caches already name its desk session. The
 * roster is the chart's (the sessions route only knows employees whose desk is in the ledger);
 * the state is the live one wherever an event has named the desk session.
 *
 * The employees' own states (the chart's dots, the overview's counts) are corrected the same
 * way by `liveEmployeeStates` at the bottom of this file, which reads the sessions attached to
 * tickets too — a ticket session running is its employee running, even though the sidebar
 * lists no ticket sessions of its own (they are reached from the ticket that started them).
 *
 * Both take their run state from the LIVE statuses first, because the two snapshots behind
 * them only move on an organization event: the sessions route is re-read when a run is
 * dispatched (`org_run`) or a ticket moves, and the chart when a summary does — and a run
 * ENDING publishes none of those. A desk would sit on 「运行中」 until some unrelated event
 * happened to arrive. The live statuses are every `session_state` the user event channel has
 * reported, and that channel reports every flip of every Session, so they are the state that
 * is actually current; the snapshots stand in for a Session no event has named.
