/**
 * One employee card on the org chart, plus the state-dot legend shown beside the chart.
 *
 * The face carries no primary action: it is a plain card that reads, and the personnel menu —
 * opening the desk session and every personnel action — is the one thing it can do. A
 * whole-card link would promise one of those many actions and steal the click from the rest.
 * Three rows: avatar with the name and title; the live state dot and its label, the workspace
 * tail, this period's spend against the budget; a thin ratio bar. The CEO's card carries no mark of
 * its own: the CEO is the tree's root, and an organization is created with the CEO titled "CEO".
 * The state the dot draws is passed in rather than read off the employee: the chart is a
 * snapshot re-read on organization events, and no event says a run ended (org-sessions.ts,
 * liveEmployeeStates).
 * Every status colour is a tone picked by meaning; running and on-desk share emerald and
 * are told apart by motion (the running dot pulses) and by their labels.
 *
 * Three ways into that one menu, all of them the same panel: the kebab in the top-right
 * corner (the only focusable thing on the card, and the pointer's discoverable route), a
 * secondary click anywhere on the card, and Shift+F10 from the focused kebab. The sidebar's
 * `useRowContextMenu` drives them, so the panel hangs off the point the gesture landed on and
 * inherits the Dropdown's dismiss stack, focus handling and viewport clamping. The card owns
 * that state: which card's menu is open is decided by the panel itself, since opening one is
 * an outside press on any other.
 *
 * The card sits on a pan/zoom canvas (org-chart-page.tsx), which is why the kebab names its
 * own cursor: the canvas wears `grab` over the whole surface, the card included — pressing
 * the inert face drags the canvas — and the one control on it has to say it is not that. A
 * secondary click never starts that pan: usePointerDrag refuses any button but the primary.
 *
 * That pan is also why press-and-hold is NOT one of the three, though the hook offers it: the
 * canvas takes pointer capture on press, so every later pointer event for that gesture is
 * retargeted to the canvas and the card never sees the move or the lift that would cancel a
 * hold. The timer would then fire on a finger that has been dragging for half a second. Touch
 * reaches the menu through the kebab, which is drawn on every card rather than revealed on
 * hover for exactly this reason.
