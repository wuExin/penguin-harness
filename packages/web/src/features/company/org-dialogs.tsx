/**
 * Organization dialogs, invoked from the sidebar's organization switcher (and the empty
 * landing): create an organization — display name, the id (still required, generated from
 * that name by the field's own button), a one-sentence mission with three examples under it,
 * the Project it belongs to when the user has several, the model its sessions run on (the
 * Project default unless chosen), the company workspace (the organization's own directory
 * unless one is picked) and the CEO's monthly budget, which is the whole company's and is
 * typed in the currency the reader reads money in but stored in USD — and an organization's
 * settings: name, mission, model, workspace, timezone, working language, approval mode, and
 * pause / resume — the one lifecycle control there is, since an organization is never deleted
 * through the App. Pause / resume writes its own PATCH the moment it is clicked; everything
 * else is a draft until Save.
 *
 * What the create dialog holds is kept as a draft (org-draft.ts) per user and Project, so an
 * accidental close, a reload or a switch back to development mode does not cost the mission
 * someone spent minutes writing; it is restored on reopen and dropped on a successful create
 * or an explicit "clear draft". A caller that opens the dialog from a proposal (the empty
 * landing's cards) passes that proposal as `initial`: it fills the name and the mission over
 * whatever the draft held, and is then written through to the draft exactly as typed text is.
 *
 * Failures stay inside the dialog: a rejected id lands under the id field, anything else in
 * a strip above the footer, and a settings load that fails offers its retry in place — the
 * fields never sit disabled behind a toast that has already gone.
 *
 * `useOrganizationCreated` is the other half of creating one: what every host of the create
 * dialog does once it succeeds — adopt the organization as the shell's current one, then open
 * where the creation leads.
