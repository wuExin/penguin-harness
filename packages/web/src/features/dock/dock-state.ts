/**
 * State of the dock system, as a tiny module-level store.
 *
 * The dock is TWO surfaces — one on the right edge, one at the bottom of the chat page —
 * and every side element is a TAB in one of them: the subagents panel, the Workspace
 * files panel, the Memory panel, the Trace panel, the messaging panel, the scheduled-tasks
 * panel, the Ports panel, and any number of terminals. A dock
 * shows its tabs in a strip and renders the active one; an OPEN dock with no tabs shows a
 * picker instead (choose what to open here), which is what the toolbar's two pull-open
 * buttons land on. Both docks can be open at once, and any tab can live in either dock
 * (the panel kinds are singletons — one tab per kind within a conversation — while
 * terminals are one tab per shell).
 *
 * The arrangement is SCOPED to the conversation it was made in, like each browser window
 * managing its own tabs: switching Sessions switches the whole arrangement, and no
 * conversation's tabs depend on another's. The shells behind terminal tabs are per-user
 * and keep running regardless; a scope only decides which of them are on screen here.
 * The draft page and pages with no Session use placeholder scopes; an arrangement made
 * while drafting is handed to the Session the first send creates (adoptDockScope).
 * Everything persists (one localStorage entry, least-recently-used scopes aging out), so
 * a reload restores each conversation's docks. Sizes are the exception: how wide/tall the
 * user likes a dock is one preference, not one per conversation.
 *
 * Closing a TAB removes it (the last tab closing also puts the dock away); a dock's ×
 * hides the surface, keeping its tabs — and, through closedDockView, everything their
 * bodies hold — for the next open. Below the desktop breakpoint the two docks render as ONE
 * merged bottom surface (a 320px-minimum right panel does not fit a phone); the stored
 * arrangement splits back apart when the window widens.
 *
 * A store (rather than component state) because the consumers live far apart: the chat
 * toolbar toggles the docks, the global hotkey flips the terminal, AppLayout points the
 * scope at the route's conversation, the chat page renders the docks, and the terminal
 * list prunes dead shells' tabs on refresh.
