## How to split the work
- First plan the 10 games (say snake, 2048, tetris, breakout, minesweeper, memory match, sokoban, space shooter, platform jumper, rhythm tap), confirm no two mechanics repeat, and fix a shared directory layout, palette and interaction spec.
- Then hand the 10 games to several subagents to implement in parallel — each subagent owns exactly one game, follows the agreed spec, and never edits another's files.

## Each game
- Its own \`games/<slug>/index.html\`: pure frontend, a single file that runs straight from file://, with no backend and no CDN assets.
- Start / restart, live score or timer, a lose-or-clear summary, both keyboard and touch controls, and the rules written on the page.
- A way back to the index page.

## Index page
- \`index.html\` at the root: a card grid listing all 10 games (name + one-line mechanic + controls), each card opening its game.
- One design language shared with every game, following the web-design skill.

## Wrap-up
- Review as a whole: the 10 mechanics really are distinct, the styling is consistent, and every index link resolves.
- Self-test each game in a browser — it starts, it ends, it restarts — then tell me how to open it.`,

## Technical constraints
- Use the SC.Widget JS API (widget.load / widget.toggle / widget.setVolume / widget.seekTo), loading https://w.soundcloud.com/player/api.js
- The iframe must stay visible (180px tall), with visual=true color=f0b90b single_active=true
- Include ONLY these 8 tracks confirmed playable (oEmbed-verified); do not add tracks that are not oEmbed-verified:
  - Warriors (S4) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/warriors
  - Worlds Collide (S5) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/worlds-collide
  - Legends Never Die (S7) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/legends-never-die
  - Phoenix (S9) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/phoenix
  - Burn It All Down (S11) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/burn-it-all-down
  - GODS (S13) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/gods
  - Heavy Is The Crown (S14) — soundcloud.com/linkinpark/heavy-is-the-crown
  - Sacrifice (S15) — soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/sacrifice

## Layout
- Left 260px sticky sidebar: the track list (S4/S5/… badge + emoji + title + year); clicking highlights with a gold border and switches tracks via SC.Widget.load() with auto_play
- Right main area: hero title + a desktop clock (80px monospace gold HH:MM:SS, refreshed every second, blinking colons) + a mood tag
- Player card: the SoundCloud iframe + a custom control bar (⏮ ▶/⏸ ⏭ + track info + a volume slider; clicking the speaker icon toggles mute)
- Mood-wave section: 15 gold animated bars, re-randomized on every track switch
- Keyboard shortcuts: Space play/pause, ← → previous/next, ↑ ↓ volume
