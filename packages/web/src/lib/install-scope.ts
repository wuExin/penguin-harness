/**
 * Scoping browser-persisted UI state to the data root it was made against.
 *
 * The report this exists for: a user deleted their data files, restarted, and the app came
 * back with the old Workspace still selected. `localStorage` has no relationship to the
 * data root at all — in the desktop app it lives in Electron's userData directory, so no
 * amount of deleting `PENGUIN_HOME` touches it — and every key that names an entity names
 * it with a compile-time constant (`admin`, `default_project`). A wipe-and-restart
 * re-provisions the same user and the same Project, the keys line up again, and the old
 * draft, Workspace registry, pins and seen markers all come back.
 *
 * So the server names its root (`<root>/install-id`, served by `GET /api/install`) and this
 * module compares that name against the one this browser last saw. A DIFFERENT name means
 * the state here was made against a root that is gone, and the keys that reference server
 * entities are cleared. Same name — including every ordinary restart — clears nothing.
 *
 * Why one stored id and a sweep, rather than putting the id into every key name:
 *   - key names stay as they are, so no module that builds a key changes and there is no
 *     migration for keys already on disk;
 *   - a key carrying a dead install id would be an orphan nothing ever reads or deletes,
 *     and each wipe would leave another full set behind. The sweep is the one place
 *     orphans are collected, and it collects them by walking the store;
 *   - the classification below stays readable as a table instead of being spread across
 *     twenty call sites.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THE SWEEP ALONE DOES NOT COVER, both of them a live copy of state the store no
 * longer holds:
 *   - modules evaluated before the sweep ran (the whole static import graph finishes before
 *     main.tsx's first statement) — a swept boot RELOADS rather than renders, see
 *     bootInstallScope;
 *   - other tabs, still open against the root that is gone — see watchInstallScope.
 *
 * FIRST SIGHT (a browser with keys but no stored id — every user upgrading into this
 * release) is indistinguishable from a wiped root, so it ADOPTS the current id and sweeps
 * nothing. Destroying legitimate state on upgrade would be a far worse bug than the one
 * being fixed. The practical consequence, which the changelog states plainly: state that is
 * ALREADY stale when this ships stays stale; only wipes from here on are handled.
