/**
 * The tab strip's view of an Agent's workflows.
 *
 * A tab is a CONTRIBUTION: a workflow's manifest puts an entry into `WebModule.sessionTabs`
 * for each page it wants beside the chat — several, or none for a handler-only workflow —
 * and the server hands them over with each page's URL resolved. `uiRev`, the content hash
 * of the workflow's `ui/` tree, is only the cache key an open tab compares to notice its
 * page changed under it (the iframe reloads on a new one). A tab whose renderer this build
 * does not carry is left out: there is nothing to draw it with.
 *
 * Chat is not one of these. It is always present and always reachable, so a workflow tab
 * disappearing (folder removed, Agent switched) falls back to Chat rather than leaving
 * the strip pointing at nothing.
