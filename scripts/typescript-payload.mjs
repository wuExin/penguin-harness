/**
 * The TypeScript compiler as something a build carries.
 *
 * The server lets the compiler decide whether a package's interfaces still fit the platform
 * (packages/server/src/plugin/typescript.ts). It
 * is a dependency of the server package, which covers an npm install and a checkout — but a
 * hot push lands on machines whose program was installed before that, and the desktop build
 * bundles the server into one file with no `node_modules` of its own. Both therefore carry
 * the compiler themselves, the way they carry node-pty: the push as one archive in its
 * assets, the desktop build staged beside the server bundle.
 *
 * Only what the compiler reads at run time: its entry and the default library files a
 * program is checked against. The language service, the tsc CLI, the locale catalogues and
 * the type declarations of the API itself are most of the package and none of it is loaded.
