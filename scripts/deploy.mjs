/**
 * One-shot build-and-deploy to a running runtime: `node scripts/deploy.mjs <port>`.
 *
 * Aimed at one ad-hoc target and run once — for deploying to a machine reached through an
 * ssh tunnel (`ssh -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<remote port> …`) as much as to a local runtime.
 *
 * Builds the web dist, compiles the platform and cli entries, and pushes all three as ONE
 * atomic version to POST /api/hmr/upgrade. Authentication is an admin session established
 * per run: PENGUIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD is read from the environment and exchanged for a cookie,
 * so no credential of any kind is written to disk — a file holding an admin-equivalent
 * secret is readable by everything running as this user, agent shells included, which makes
 * the file itself the vulnerability.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   PENGUIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… node scripts/deploy.mjs 53531
 *   PENGUIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… node scripts/deploy.mjs 53531 --skip-web-build
 *   PENGUIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… node scripts/deploy.mjs https://box.example.com
